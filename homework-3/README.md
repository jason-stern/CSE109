fileManip

For this project, you need to complete the following work which was left unfinished by the previous developer.
* Stevens-style wrap all the functions listed in syscalls.h in a syscalls.c file
* Implement all the functions listed in fileManipFuncs.h in a fileManipFuncs.c file
* Create a makefile to compile the syscalls.c. fileManipFuncs.c, and fileManip.c files and link the resultant .o files together with the printMsgs.o file to create the fileManip executable

Notes:
* Do not edit any file with a comment at the top of "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE"
* Follow the format of the makefiles we've been using
* Use your Stevens-style wrapped file operations for this project
* When copying the remote file, read NUM_BYTES_TO_COPY_AT_A_TIME bytes at a time and place into a buffer that you allocated space for on the heap using Malloc
* Make sure you can copy a file from anywhere (absolute path or relative path or no path)
* Don't forget to free any memory you allocate on the heap; check with valgrind
* As you execute the operations in the cmdsFile, match the output from running ~merle/109/inClassPrograms/fileManipRef
* Use getLine and sscanf to work your way through the cmdsFile
* Since you'll be allocating memory
